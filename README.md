# ansible-infrastructure
Ansible playbooks that automatically deploy the infrastructure used for RIT's 2017 GenCyber summer camp.

There are two components to this infrastructure: the core services offered to all floors of the hospital,
and the services specific to each floor. Because these components are vastly different, their configs and
playbooks have been separated into two different subdirectories. README files in each subdirectory describe
the contents of that subdirectory.
