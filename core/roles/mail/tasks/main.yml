# main.yml - Performs the Postfix and Horde installations.
# This playbook requires the -K flag. This playbook is designed
# to be run against a system with Debian 8 installed on it.
# This playbook also requires that a shell other than bash set for the user 
# on the remote system. Ansible really doesn't like it when you uninstall bash
# midway through a play if it's using it, and this is necessary in order
# to properly install the vulnerable version of bash. The shell used for 
# testing was sh, so in theory it should work in any other modern shell, but 
# YMMV.
